create a virtual environment and activate it

install requirements.txt that is included w/the assignment

write a small flask app in application.py that:

serves the template application-form.html at the route /application-form. use the application-form made in skills-html-css

handles submission of a form in application-form.html to the route /application

gets the first/last name/ salary/job title from teh form submission

returns a response that acknowledges their application. this should repeat their name, title, and salary requirements like:

"thank you, jessica mchackbright, for applying to be a QA engineer. Your minum salary requiremen is x dollars"

You should do that w/a jinja template 

create a new template called base.html. have your other two templates inherit from base.html using jinja's (% extend %) and {% block %} syntax
